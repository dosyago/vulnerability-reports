## Matthew Bryant ([@IAmMandatory](https://twitter.com/iammandatory)) [BrowserGap](https://browsergap.xyz) SSRF to Cloud Metadata Server Vulnerability

**Time**: 8:05 AM Oct 30 2019 (GMT+8)

This vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by [Matthew Bryant](https://twitter.com/iammandatory), a security researcher and owner of the startup [Refinery Labs](https://www.refinery.io/). Refinery Labs enables, among other things, code-less workflow automation. It's really cool, you should check it out!

Even though I had no previous association with Matthew, after I shared the [Free 30 Minute Demo site](https://free.cloudbrowser.xyz) on [Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21373756), Matthew reached out to me via email with a really thorough report of a vulnerability he discovered. I immediately suspended the service and looked into the issue that was raised. I pushed out a couple of mitigations and ran it by Matthew who said it looked good and I should also consider further networking restrictions using iptables, which I then implemented. 

The vulnerability involved the instance where the remote isolated browser run being privileged to access internal cloud provider metadata services related to all services I run on that cloud provider. A [similar vulnerability previously affected Shopify](https://hackerone.com/reports/341876). 

The mitigations involved using iptables and firewall rules to restrict access of remote browser instances to internal and link local network addresses. I posted [a summary](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21394686) of the play-by-play to the original HN post.
